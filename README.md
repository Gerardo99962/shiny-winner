## ⚖️ Ethics & Principles

This project is built around the following principles:

1. **Public information only**  
   No private, leaked, or paywalled data is indexed.

2. **Signals, not conclusions**  
   The system does not assert identity, guilt, intent, or relationships.

3. **Source transparency**  
   Every signal links back to its original public source.

4. **User responsibility**  
   Interpretation is left to the user. The system does not label or rank people.

5. **Abuse resistance**  
   Design choices intentionally limit misuse, automation, and mass targeting.

See [`ETHICS.md`](./ETHICS.md) for full details.
