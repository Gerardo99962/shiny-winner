6# Ethics & Responsible Use Policy

## Open Public People Search

This document defines the ethical boundaries, design intent, and responsible-use principles of this project.  
These principles are **non-negotiable** and guide all technical and product decisions.

---

## 1. Core Ethical Position

This project exists to support **research, investigation, journalism, and due diligence** using **publicly available information only**.

It does **not** exist to:
- Judge individuals
- Predict behavior
- Assign reputation scores
- Enable surveillance or harassment
- Replace human judgment

The system presents **signals**, not conclusions.

---

## 2. Public Information Only

The system is strictly limited to:
- Information that is publicly accessible without authentication
- Content intentionally published to public platforms
- Material that can be independently verified by the user

The system **will not** index or aggregate:
- Private, leaked, or hacked data
- Paywalled content
- Data obtained through deception
- Personal contact details (addresses, phone numbers, emails)
- Government or commercial databases intended for restricted use

---

## 3. No Identity Resolution

This project intentionally avoids **identity resolution**.

That means:
- No automatic merging of profiles
- No claims that two records refer to the same person
- No inferred relationships (family, employment, associates)
- No facial recognition or biometric analysis

If two public signals appear similar, they are presented **separately and neutrally**.

---

## 4. No Profiling or Scoring

The system does not:
- Assign trustworthiness, risk, or intent
- Rank individuals
- Produce “background checks”
- Generate behavioral predictions

Any weighting or confidence indicators apply only to the **quality and quantity of signals**, not to people themselves.

---

## 5. Transparency & Source Integrity

Every signal must:
- Preserve original context
- Link directly to the source
- Clearly identify its platform and timestamp

The system does not rewrite, paraphrase, or launder content in a way that obscures origin or meaning.

---

## 6. User Responsibility

Users are responsible for:
- Verifying sources
- Interpreting information responsibly
- Complying with applicable laws and regulations
- Using the system for lawful, ethical purposes

The project does not claim accuracy, completeness, or truth — only access to public signals.

---

## 7. Abuse Prevention & Friction

The system is intentionally designed to resist misuse by:
- Limiting bulk queries
- Discouraging automation
- Avoiding mass export features
- Avoiding notifications or tracking of individuals
- Avoiding real-time monitoring

Features that meaningfully increase the risk of stalking, harassment, or targeting will not be implemented.

---

## 8. Children & Vulnerable Individuals

This system is **not intended** for researching minors.

Content involving:
- Children
- Vulnerable individuals
- Victims of crime

must be handled with extreme care and may be excluded entirely depending on risk.

---

## 9. Law Enforcement & Commercial Use

This project is not designed as:
- A law enforcement surveillance tool
- A commercial data broker
- A background check service

Any use in official or commercial contexts must independently assess legal and ethical compliance.

---

## 10. Ethical Evolution

Ethics are not static.

As this project evolves:
- Ethical review takes precedence over feature expansion
- Community feedback is encouraged
- Features may be removed if they create unacceptable risk

Technical capability does not justify implementation.

---

## 11. Enforcement

Contributions or deployments that violate these principles may be:
- Rejected
- Reverted
- Removed

Open source does not mean ethically neutral.

---

## 12. Summary

**Just because something is possible does not mean it should be built.**

This project chooses:
- Restraint over reach
- Transparency over power
- Context over conclusions

These values define the project as much as the code./docs

## ⚖️ Ethics & Principles

This project is built around the following principles:

1. **Public information only**  
   No private, leaked, or paywalled data is indexed.

2. **Signals, not conclusions**  
   The system does not assert identity, guilt, intent, or relationships.

3. **Source transparency**  
   Every signal links back to its original public source.

4. **User responsibility**  
   Interpretation is left to the user. The system does not label or rank people.

5. **Abuse resistance**  
   Design choices intentionally limit misuse, automation, and mass targeting.

See [`ETHICS.md`](./ETHICS.md) for full details.
